    <p class="abstract"><strong>Viua VM</strong> is a register-based virtual machine,
    programmable in high-level assembly;
    it is designed for <em>reliability</em>, <em>predictability</em>, <em>error-tolerance</em>, <em>concurrency</em> and
    <em>fine-grained control</em> over behaviour of the software.
    </p>

    <p class="summary-first-part">The VM achieves its design goals by equipping programmers with
    a wide array of tools to craft their software.
    </p>

    <p class="summary-part"><strong>Reliability</strong> and <strong>error-tolerance</strong> is achieved by a robust
    system of <em>exception-based error handling</em>, and <em>process restarting</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="summary-part"><strong>Predictability</strong> and fine-grained <strong>control</strong> over software is
    achieved by separating programmers from the machine with only a thin layer of programming language (a high-level
    assembly).</p>

    <p class="note for-summary">The "synchronised" and "unsynchronised" are used instead of "asychronous" and "sychronous" on purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="summary-last-part">VM supports two approaches to <strong>concurrency</strong>: an unsychronised, actor-based model using processes
    communicating via asynchronous message-passing; and a synchronised model using coroutines communicating via calls and return values.

    <h2> Features </h2>
    <p> Machine provides programmers with the following set of features ("WIP" means "Work In Progress", "PF" means "Planned Feature"):
        <ul>
            <li>compile-time checks of code perfomed by the assembler</li>
            <li>separate compilation (assembler is able to produce "object files")</li>
            <li>static and dynamic linking</li>
            <li>hot-swapping dynamically linked modules (WIP)</li>
            <li>exception-based error handling (every object is throwable and catchable; VM catches C++ exceptions thrown in foreign functions)</li>
            <li>first-class functions</li>
            <li>arity-based function overloading</li>
            <li>mechanisms for static and dynamic dispatch of method calls</li>
            <li>concurrency</li>
            <li>parallelism (given sufficient hardware resources)</li>
            <li>scope-based resource management (no garbage collector)</li>
            <li>coroutines (PF)</li>
            <li>non-blocking foreign function interface (requires at least two-core CPU)</li>
            <li>virtual process restarting (via user-programmed watchdog process)</li>
            <li>clean FFI for straightforward cooperation with C++ code</li>
            <li>no-copy function returns</li>
            <li>by-copy and by-move parameter passing to functions</li>
            <li>safe pointers for inside-VM objects</li>
            <li>move semantics for many instructions</li>
            <li>closures with multiple capture mechanisms (by-copy, by-reference, by-move)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2> Requirements </h2>
    <p> Machine requires the following software to be available:
        <ul>
            <li> a modern C++ compiler supporting C++14; builds are tested with GCC, and Clang++</li>
            <li> Python 3.5 (or later) is required to run the test suite </li>
            <li> recent version of Valgrind (3.11 and later) is required for memory tests </li>
            <li> GNU Make (or compatible build system) is required to compile the code </li>
            <li> developer scripts assume presence of standard *nix tools: <code>sed</code>, <code>dc</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>xargs</code>, a sh-compatible shell, and Linux operating system </li>
            <li> compilation without developer scripts requires a *nix-like operating system </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Also, it is assumed that the machine is compiled and run on a *nix-like operating system, and on C++ runtime with enabled exceptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Development status</h2>
    <p>Viua is late-alpha grade software, it is by no means production ready.</p>
